/**
 The DrawManager acts as the middle man for the Canvas and the DrawModel.
 The DrawViewController and SocketIOManager need to communicate to both the
 Canvas and the DrawModel, but at inconsistent times, so all communication
 from the DrawViewController and SocketIOManger passes through the DrawManager
 and is passed to the Canvas and DrawModel, and vice versa.
 
 When an instance of the DrawManager is initiated with the intention of using it,
 it is imortant to set the *canvas* and *drawModel* properties.
