     - If this is the first touch of a user's draw, then a new Line object is
     created, a new Segment object created (only adding the *start* property),
     and the new Line object is sent to the server.
     - If this is not the first touch of a user's draw, then either:
     - A new *currentSegment* is created, and the *start* property is set
     - Or the *currentSegment* is completed, that Segment is added to *currentLine*,
     *currentSegment* is sent to the DrawManager to be sent to the server, and
     a new *currentSegment* is created.
